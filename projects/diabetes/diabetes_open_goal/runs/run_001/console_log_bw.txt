# Description of the Dataset
## General Description
The dataset includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), year 2015.
The original BRFSS, from which this dataset is derived, is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of
preventative services. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant
responses.

## Data Files
The dataset consists of 1 data file:

### "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 253,680 responses (rows) and 22 features (columns).
All rows with missing values were removed from the original dataset; the current file contains no missing values.

The columns in the dataset are:

#1 `Diabetes_binary`: (int, bool) Diabetes (0=no, 1=yes)
#2 `HighBP`: (int, bool) High Blood Pressure (0=no, 1=yes)
#3 `HighChol`: (int, bool) High Cholesterol (0=no, 1=yes)
#4 `CholCheck`: (int, bool) Cholesterol check in 5 years (0=no, 1=yes)
#5 `BMI`: (int, numerical) Body Mass Index
#6 `Smoker`: (int, bool) (0=no, 1=yes)
#7 `Stroke`: (int, bool) Stroke (0=no, 1=yes)
#8 `HeartDiseaseorAttack': (int, bool) coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI), (0=no, 1=yes)
#9 `PhysActivity`: (int, bool) Physical Activity in past 30 days (0=no, 1=yes)
#10 `Fruits`: (int, bool) Consume one fruit or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#11 `Veggies`: (int, bool) Consume one Vegetable or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#12 `HvyAlcoholConsump` (int, bool) Heavy drinkers (0=no, 1=yes)
#13 `AnyHealthcare` (int, bool) Have any kind of health care coverage (0=no, 1=yes)
#14 `NoDocbcCost` (int, bool) Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost? (0=no, 1=yes)
#15 `GenHlth` (int, ordinal) self-reported health (1=excellent, 2=very good, 3=good, 4=fair, 5=poor)
#16 `MentHlth` (int, ordinal) How many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#17 `PhysHlth` (int, ordinal) Hor how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#18 `DiffWalk` (int, bool) Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? (0=no, 1=yes)
#19 `Sex` (int, categorical) Sex (0=female, 1=male)
#20 `Age` (int, ordinal) Age, 13-level age category in intervals of 5 years (1= 18 - 24, 2= 25 - 29, ..., 12= 75 - 79, 13 = 80 or older)
#21 `Education` (int, ordinal) Education level on a scale of 1 - 6 (1=Never attended school, 2=Elementary, 3=Some high school, 4=High school, 5=Some
college, 6=College)
#22 `Income` (int, ordinal) Income scale on a scale of 1 to 8 (1= <=10K, 2= <=15K, 3= <=20K, 4= <=25K, 5= <=35K, 6= <=50K, 7= <=75K, 8= >75K)

Here are the first few lines of the file:

[5] ----- USER {DataExplorer} -> "Data Exploration Code"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of a data-exploration phase, please write a complete short Python code for getting a first sense of the data.

Your code should create an output text file named "data_exploration.txt", which should contain a summary of the data.

The output file should be self-contained; any results you choose to save to this file should be accompanied with a short header.

The output file should be formatted as follows:


# Data Size
<Measure of the scale of our data (e.g., number of rows, number of columns)>

# Summary Statistics
<Summary statistics of all or key variables>

# Categorical Variables
<As applicable, list here categorical values and their most common values>

# Missing Values
<Counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values>
<As applicable, counts of special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined if any (check in the "Description of the Dataset" above for any)>

# <title of other summary you deem relevant, if any>
<Add any other summary of the data you deem relevant>

# <etc for any other summary you deem relevant.>


If any of the above sections is not applicable, then write "# Not Applicable" under that section.

If needed, you can use the following packages which are already installed:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy')

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

This code will write a data exploration summary to a text file named "data_exploration.txt".

The summary includes:
- Data Size: Gives the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Summary Statistics: Gives count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values of every column.
- Categorical Variables: Lists all categorical variables and their most common values.
- Missing Values: Gives the counts of missing values in every column.

Note: Please provide the right path to the dataset while reading it in line 6 if the dataset is not in the same directory as this python script.

Please carefully check the Python code and the output for possible issues, and provide a point-by-point assessment.
Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    "NaN values in the output file":
        ("CONCERN", "The output contains NaN values in ..."),
    "Output file should be self-contained":
        ("CONCERN", "A header is missing for ..."),
    "Output file should contain all the required analysis":
        ("OK", "Nothing is missing"),
    "Sensible results":
        ("CONCERN", "The average of ... does not make sense"),
    "<Any other issues you find>":
        ("CONCERN", "<Issue description>"),
    "<Any other point you checked and asserted is OK>":
        ("OK", "<Assertion description>"),
}


Notes:
(1) Generalize.
The points above are just examples, provided as a basis from which you can generalize to checks relevant to our specific code.
(2) Skip irrelevant points.
If any of the points above are not applicable, you can skip them.
(3) Add more checks.
You can also add as many other relevant checks, both positive ("OK", "...") and negative ("CONCERN", "...").
(4) Be specific.
Be specific in the description of the checks (keys) and assessment (values), so that it is clear what you are referring to in the code.

# Description of the Original Dataset
## General Description
The dataset includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), year 2015.
The original BRFSS, from which this dataset is derived, is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of
preventative services. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant
responses.

## Data Files
The dataset consists of 1 data file:

### "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 253,680 responses (rows) and 22 features (columns).
All rows with missing values were removed from the original dataset; the current file contains no missing values.

The columns in the dataset are:

#1 `Diabetes_binary`: (int, bool) Diabetes (0=no, 1=yes)
#2 `HighBP`: (int, bool) High Blood Pressure (0=no, 1=yes)
#3 `HighChol`: (int, bool) High Cholesterol (0=no, 1=yes)
#4 `CholCheck`: (int, bool) Cholesterol check in 5 years (0=no, 1=yes)
#5 `BMI`: (int, numerical) Body Mass Index

#9 `PhysActivity`: (int, bool) Physical Activity in past 30 days (0=no, 1=yes)
#10 `Fruits`: (int, bool) Consume one fruit or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#11 `Veggies`: (int, bool) Consume one Vegetable or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#12 `HvyAlcoholConsump` (int, bool) Heavy drinkers (0=no, 1=yes)
#13 `AnyHealthcare` (int, bool) Have any kind of health care coverage (0=no, 1=yes)
#14 `NoDocbcCost` (int, bool) Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost? (0=no, 1=yes)
#15 `GenHlth` (int, ordinal) self-reported health (1=excellent, 2=very good, 3=good, 4=fair, 5=poor)
#16 `MentHlth` (int, ordinal) How many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#17 `PhysHlth` (int, ordinal) Hor how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#18 `DiffWalk` (int, bool) Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? (0=no, 1=yes)

```latex
\section{Code Explanation}
The code performs a data exploration on the given dataset extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year
2015. The dataset contains information on diabetes related factors of 253,680 respondents.

The data exploration starts by loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe. Then, it performs several analysis steps and writes the results into an
output file named "data_exploration.txt".

The analysis steps include:

1. Data Size: The code calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset using the shape attribute of the dataframe and writes the results into
the output file.

2. Summary Statistics: The code computes summary statistics of the numerical columns in the dataset using the describe() function and writes the
results into the output file.

3. Categorical Variables: The code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset and for each variable, it determines the most common value
(mode) using the mode() function and writes the variable name and the corresponding mode into the output file.

4. Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset using the isnull() function and calculates the count of missing values for each
column. It then writes the count of missing values into the output file.

5. Special Numeric Values: The code checks for any special numeric values (99 or 88) that stand for unknown or undefined values in each column of the
dataset. It calculates the count of such values for each column and writes the column name and the count of special numeric values into the output
file.

The output file "data_exploration.txt" will contain the following information:
- Data size (number of rows and columns)
- Summary statistics of numerical columns
- Most common value for each categorical variable
- Count of missing values for each column
- Count of special numeric values that stand for unknown or undefined values in each column

The data exploration code provides an overview of the dataset, including its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, missing values, and any
special values that require further attention. This information is essential for understanding the data and identifying potential issues that may
impact subsequent analysis or modeling.

Please suggest a research goal and an hypothesis that can be studied using only the provided dataset.
The goal and hypothesis should be interesting and novel.

Guidelines:

* Try to avoid trivial hypotheses (like just testing for simple linear associations).
Instead, you could perhaps explore more complex associations and relationships, like testing for moderation effects or interactions between variables.

* Do not limit yourself to the provided data structure and variables; you can create new variables from the existing ones, and use them in your
hypotheses.

* Make sure that your suggested hypothesis can be studied using only the provided dataset, without requiring any additional data. In particular, pay
attention to using only data available based on the provided headers of our data files (see "Description of the Original Dataset", above).

* Avoid goals and hypotheses that involve ethic issues like sociodemographic (Income, Education, etc.) and psychological (Mental Health) variables.
Note though that you can, and should, still use these as confounding variables if needed.
* Do not suggest methodology. Just the goal and an hypothesis.

# Research Goal:
To identify patterns, interactions, and visible trends among health behaviors (physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking and alcohol
consumption), the incidence of diabetes, and how these are affected by existing health conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
stroke, and heart disease/attack.

# Hypothesis:
Even after controlling for the confounding effects of body mass index (BMI), high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, those individuals who engage
in regular physical activity, consume fruits and vegetables daily, and avoid smoking and heavy drinking are less likely to have diabetes. However, the
presence of a history of stroke or heart disease may strengthen the relationship between these health behaviors and the incidence of diabetes.

Specifically:
* If the hypothesis cannot be tested using only the provided dataset (without requiring additional data), suggest how to modify the hypothesis to
better fit the dataset.
* If the hypothesis is not interesting and novel, suggest how to modify it to make it more interesting.
* If the hypothesis is broad or convoluted, suggest how best to focus it on a single well defined question.


Do not provide positive feedback; if these conditions are all satisfied, just respond with:
"The research goal does not require any changes".
If you feel that the initial goal and hypothesis satisfy the above conditions, respond solely with "The research goal does not require any changes".

* The research goal and hypothesis seem to fit well with the available dataset. All the variables mentioned in the hypothesis, such as physical
activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking and alcohol consumption, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, and heart disease are
available in the data. The response variable, diabetes, is also available.

* The hypothesis is interesting as it seems to shed light on the effects of multiple health behaviors on the likelihood of having diabetes, while also
accounting for the impact of the existing health conditions. The role of stroke and heart disease in strengthening the association between health
behaviors and diabetes is particularly interesting and could lead to meaningful insights.

* The hypothesis is broad but within an acceptable range. However, it could be more focused if it specifically defined 'regular physical activity',
'consume fruits and vegetables daily', 'avoid smoking' and 'heavy drinking'. It could help to focus on a specific health behavior or to fewer
confounding health conditions.

Suggestion:
# Hypothesis:
Participants who engage in physical activity in the past 30 days, daily vegetable consumption, and no heavy alcohol consumption have a reduced
probability of having diabetes, controlling for the effects of high blood pressure and BMI. Having a history of stroke increases the likelihood of
diabetes regardless of physical activity.

Please write literature-search queries that we can use to search for papers related to our study.

You would need to compose search queries to identify prior papers covering these 2 areas:
"dataset": papers that use the same or similar datasets as in our study
"questions": papers that ask questions similar to our study

Return your answer as a `Dict[str, List[str]]`, where the keys are the 2 areas noted above, and the values are lists of query string. Each individual
query should be a string with up to 5-10 words.

For example, for a study reporting waning of the efficacy of the covid-19 BNT162b2 vaccine based on analysis of the "United Kingdom National Core Data
(UK-NCD)", the queries could be:

{
    "dataset": ['The UK-NCD dataset', 'covid-19 vaccine efficacy dataset']
    "questions": ['covid-19 vaccine efficacy over time', 'covid-19 vaccine waning']
}


Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, List[str]] wrapped within a triple backtick 'python' code block.

# Overall Description of the Dataset
The dataset includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), year 2015.
The original BRFSS, from which this dataset is derived, is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of
preventative services. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant
responses.

Based on the result of the literature search above, please revise, or completely re-write, the research goal and hypothesis that we have so that they
do not completely overlap existing literature.

Guidelines:

* Try to avoid trivial hypotheses (like just testing for simple linear associations).
Instead, you could perhaps explore more complex associations and relationships, like testing for moderation effects or interactions between variables.

* Do not limit yourself to the provided data structure and variables; you can create new variables from the existing ones, and use them in your
hypotheses.

* Make sure that your suggested hypothesis can be studied using only the provided dataset, without requiring any additional data. In particular, pay
attention to using only data available based on the provided headers of our data files (see "Description of the Original Dataset", above).

* Avoid goals and hypotheses that involve ethic issues like sociodemographic (Income, Education, etc.) and psychological (Mental Health) variables.
Note though that you can, and should, still use these as confounding variables if needed.
* Do not suggest methodology. Just the goal and an hypothesis.

# Research Goal:
Our research aims to investigate how the interplay between lifestyle behaviors and certain medical conditions influence the risk of diabetes, with
particular focus on the moderating effect of physical mobility.

# Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that while regular physical activity correlates negatively with diabetes incidence (i.e., physically active people are less likely to
have diabetes), this relationship may be moderated by an individual's physical mobility (ability to walk or climb stairs). Specifically, individuals
who are physically active but have some mobility difficulties may have an increased risk of diabetes compared to those who are equally active but
without mobility difficulties. This hypothesis takes into account potential confounding factors such as body mass index (BMI), high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, smoking, and heavy drinking.

# Papers Most Similar to our Research Goal
ID: 'Shankar2006TheAA'
Title: 'The association among smoking, heavy drinking, and chronic kidney disease.'
Journal and year: 'American journal of epidemiology (2006)'
TLDR: 'Smoking and heavy drinking, defined as consumption of four or more servings of alcohol per day, were associated with CKD, independent of
several important confounders, in a population-based cohort in Wisconsin.'


ID: 'Hsia2005PhysicalAA'
Title: 'Physical activity and diabetes risk in postmenopausal women.'
Journal and year: 'American journal of preventive medicine (2005)'
TLDR: 'Findings suggest a stronger and more independent association of physical inactivity with development of diabetes in Caucasian women than in
minority women, but could also be explained by less precise risk estimates in minorityWomen or the role of chance.'


ID: 'Kyu2016PhysicalAA'
Title: 'Physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke events: systematic review and
dose-response meta-analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013'
Journal and year: 'The BMJ (2016)'
TLDR: 'People who achieve total physical activity levels several times higher than the current recommended minimum level have a significant reduction
in the risk of the five diseases studied.'


ID: 'Figaro2006DiabetesIA'
Title: 'Diabetes, Inflammation, and Functional Decline in Older Adults'
Journal and year: 'Diabetes Care (2006)'
TLDR: 'In initially high-functioning older adults, those with diabetes and higher inflammatory burden had an increased risk of functional decline and
interventions at early stages to reduce inflammation may preserve function in these individuals.'


ID: 'Aune2015PhysicalAA'
Title: 'Physical activity and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis'
Journal and year: 'European Journal of Epidemiology (2015)'
TLDR: 'There is strong evidence for an inverse association between physical activity and risk of type 2 diabetes, which may partly be mediated by
reduced adiposity, and all subtypes of physical activity appear to be beneficial.'

We would like to test the specified hypotheses using the provided dataset.
We need to think of the relevant statistical issues and the most adequate statistical tests for each hypothesis.

Review the "Description of the Original Dataset" and "Data Exploration Code and Output" provided above, and return your assessment as a Python
dictionary with the following structure:

{
    'ISSUES': {
        '<Issue>': '<Description of the issue and how it should be accounted for>',
        '<Another issue>': '...',
        # ...

    'HYPOTHESES': {
        '<Hypothesis>': '<Statistical test>',
        '<another Hypothesis>': '...',
        # ...
}



- "ISSUES":
The keys of this dictionary should briefly describe the statistical issues that we should account for.
The values should describe the issue and how it should be accounted for in the statistical tests.
For possible issues (keys), consider for example:
* Confounding variables (see available variables in the dataset that we can adjust for).
* Missing data points.
* Dependencies between data points.
* Multiple comparisons.
* Imbalanced data.
* Any other relevant statistical issues.

- Hypotheses.
The keys of this dictionary should briefly describe each of our hypotheses.
The values of this dictionary
should specify the most adequate statistical test for each hypothesis, and describe how it should be performed while accounting for any issues you
have outlined above.

For each of our hypotheses, suggest a *single* statistical test.
If there are several possible ways to test a given hypothesis, specify only *one* statistical test (the simplest one).

Example:


{
    'ISSUES': {
        'Missing data points': 'Based on the Data Exploration Code and Output, we should drop lines with missing data in ...',
        'Confounding variables': 'We should adjust for ...',
    },
    'HYPOTHESES': {
        "xxx is associated with yyy and zzz":
            "Linear regression with xxx as the independent variable and yyy and zzz as the dependent variables while adjusting for aaa, bbb, ccc",
        "The association between xxx and yyy is moderated by zzz":
            "Repeat the above linear regression, while adding the interaction term between yyy and zzz",
}


These of course are just examples. Your actual response should be based on the "Goal and Hypothesis", "Description of the Original Dataset", and "Data
Exploration Code and Output".

Note how in the example shown the different hypotheses are connected to each other, building towards a single
study goal.

Remember to return a valid Python dictionary with the structure described above.

Thank you for the Goal and Hypothesis.

[8] ----- USER {Debugger} -> "Data Analysis Code"  <background_hypothesis_testing_plan>  -------------------------------------------------------------
# Hypothesis Testing Plan
## Statistical considerations:
### Confounding variables:
We should adjust for potential confounding variables such as BMI, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, smoking, and heavy
drinking to account for their potential influence on the relationship between physical activity, mobility difficulties, and diabetes risk.
### Missing data points:
Based on the Data Exploration Code and Output, there are no missing data points in the dataset. However, we should check for any unknown/undefined
values as indicated by the special numeric values (e.g., 99 or 88) and handle them appropriately.
### Dependencies between data points:
We need to account for potential dependencies between data points due to the hierarchical nature of the data, as the dataset is derived from a survey
that collects responses from individuals. We can consider using appropriate mixed-effects models or clustering techniques that account for the
potential correlations within individuals.

## Hypotheses:
### Hypothesis:
The association between physical activity and diabetes risk is moderated by physical mobility difficulties
### Test:
To test this hypothesis, we can perform a logistic regression analysis with diabetes_binary as the dependent variable, physical activity as the
independent variable, and physical mobility difficulties as the moderator variable. We should adjust for potential confounding variables such as BMI,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, smoking, and heavy drinking. We can include interaction terms between physical activity
and physical mobility difficulties to assess moderation.

### Hypothesis:
The relationship between physical activity and diabetes risk differs based on gender
### Test:
To test this hypothesis, we can perform a logistic regression analysis with diabetes_binary as the dependent variable, physical activity as the
independent variable, and gender as the moderator variable. We should adjust for potential confounding variables such as BMI, high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, smoking, and heavy drinking. We can include interaction terms between physical activity and gender to assess
moderation.

### Hypothesis:
The relationship between physical activity and diabetes risk differs based on age
### Test:
To test this hypothesis, we can perform a logistic regression analysis with diabetes_binary as the dependent variable, physical activity as the
independent variable, and age as the moderator variable. We should adjust for potential confounding variables such as BMI, high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, smoking, and heavy drinking. We can include interaction terms between physical activity and age to assess
moderation.

[10] COMMENTER -> "Data Analysis Code"  <after_background>  : Background messages completed. Requesting "Data Analysis code".

[11] ---- USER {Debugger} -> "Data Analysis Code"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a complete Python code to analyze the data and create dataframes as basis for scientific Tables for our paper.

The code must have the following sections (with these exact capitalized headers):

`# IMPORT`
`import pickle`
You can also import here any other packages you need from:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'statsmodels', 'sklearn', 'pickle')


`# LOAD DATA`
Load the data from the original data files described above (see "Description of the Original Dataset").


`# DATASET PREPARATIONS`
* Join data files as needed.
* Dealing with missing, unknown, or undefined values, or with special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined (check in the "Description of
the Original Dataset" for any such values, and consider also the "Output of the Data Exploration Code").
* Create new variables as needed.
* Restrict the data based on exclusion/inclusion criteria (to match study goal, if applicable).
* Standardize numeric values with different units into same-unit values.

If no dataset preparations are needed, write below this header:
`# No dataset preparations are needed.`


`# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS`
* In light of our study goals and the hypothesis testing plan (see above "Goal and Hypothesis" and "Hypothesis Testing Plan"), decide whether and
which descriptive statistics are needed to be included in the research paper and create a relevant table.

For example:
`## Table 0: "Descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex"`
Write here the code to create a descriptive statistics dataframe `df0` and save it using:
`df0.to_pickle('table_0.pkl')`

If no descriptive statistics are needed, write:
`# No descriptive statistics table is needed.`


`# PREPROCESSING`
Perform any preprocessing steps needed to prepare the data for the analysis.
For example, as applicable:
* Creating dummy variables for categorical variables.
* Any other data preprocessing you deem relevant.

If no preprocessing is needed, write:
`# No preprocessing is needed, because <your reasons here>.`


`# ANALYSIS`
Considering our "Goal and Hypothesis" and "Hypothesis Testing Plan", decide on 1-3 tables (in addition to the above descriptive statistics, if any) we
should create for our scientific paper. Typically, we should have at least one table for each hypothesis test.

For each such scientific table:
[a] Write a comment with a suggested table's caption.
Choose a caption that clearly describes the table's content and its purpose.
For example:
`## Table 1: "Test of association between age and risk of death, accounting for sex and race"`
Avoid generic captions such as `## Table 1: "Results of analysis"`.

[b] Perform analysis
- Perform appropriate analysis and/or statistical tests (see above our "Hypothesis Testing Plan").
- Account for relevant confounding variables, as applicable.
- Note that you may need to perform more than one test for each hypothesis.
- Try using inherent functionality and syntax provided in functions from the available Python packages (above). Avoid, as possible, manually
implementing generically available functionality.
For example, to include interactions in regression analysis (if applicable), use the `formula = "y ~ a * b"` syntax in statsmodels formulas, rather
than trying to manually multiply the variables.
{mediation_note_if_applicable}
[c] Create and save a dataframe representing the scientific table (`df1`, `df2`, etc):
* Only include information that is relevant and suitable for inclusion in a scientific table.
* Nominal values should be accompanied by a measure of uncertainty (CI or STD and p-value).
* Exclude data not important to the research goal, or that are too technical.
* Do not repeat the same data in multiple tables.
* The table should have labels for both the columns and the index (rows):
    - As possible, do not invent new names; just keep the original variable names from the dataset.
    - As applicable, also keep any attr names from statistical test results.


Overall, the section should have the following structure:

`# ANALYSIS`
`## Table 1: <your chosen table name here>`
Write here the code to analyze the data and create a dataframe df1 for the table 1
`df1.to_pickle('table_1.pkl')`

`## Table 2: <your chosen table name here>`
etc, up to 3 tables.


# SAVE ADDITIONAL RESULTS
At the end of the code, after completing the tables, create a dict containing any additional results you deem important to include in the scientific
paper, and save it to a pkl file 'additional_results.pkl'.

For example:

`additional_results = {
    'Total number of observations': <xxx>,
    'accuracy of <mode name> model': <xxx>,
    # etc, any other results and important parameters that are not included in the tables
}
with open('additional_results.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(additional_results, f)
`

Avoid the following:
Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code including all '# HEADERS' sections.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.
Avoid convoluted or indirect methods of data extraction and manipulation; For clarity, use direct attribute access for clarity and simplicity.
For clarity, access dataframes using string-based column/index names, rather than integer-based column/index positions.

values. Let's use median imputation in this case. Here is the corrected code:

# Checking df: index
## table_0.pkl:
The index of the table table_0.pkl is just a range from 0 to 1.

Please revise the code making sure the table is built with an index that has meaningful row labels.

Labeling row with sequential numbers is not common in scientific tables.
Though, if you are sure that starting each row with a sequential number is really what you want, then convert it from int to strings, so that it is
clear that it is not a mistake.


# Instructions:
Please rewrite the complete code again with these issues corrected.

# General formatting instructions:
Even if you are changing just a few lines, you must return the complete code again in a single code block, including the unchanged parts, so that I
can just copy-paste and run it.
Remember, your code must contain the following sections:

## Request Review of code flaws
The code runs without any obvious bugs, but I am worried that it may have some fundamental mathematical or statistical flaws.
I will need you to carefully check the Python code for possible flaws.
Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    # * CHECK FOR FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS:
    # Check for any fundamental mathematical or statistical flaws in the code.
    # For example:
    "The analysis of <analysis name>": ("OK", "It is correct to ... "),
    "The analysis of <other analysis name>": ("CONCERN", "Forgot to include ..."),
    "The analysis of xxx vs yyy": ("CONCERN", "Different units were not standardized"),

    # * CHECK FOR WRONG CALCULATIONS:
    # Explicitly list all key calculation in the code and look carefully for any mistakes.
    # You should directly cut and paste the key calculations from the code, and carefully assess them.
    # For example:
    "mean_signal = np.mean(signal)": ("OK", "The mean is calculated correctly"),
    "sem_signal = np.std(signal)": ("CONCERN", "Forgot to divide by sqrt(n)"),
    "formula = 'y ~ a : b + c'": ("CONCERN", "The formula accounts for the interaction between a and b
    but does not include their main effects"),

    # * CHECK FOR MATH TRIVIALITIES:
    # Check for any mathematically trivial assessments / statistical tests.
    # For example:
    "The test of positivity of mean(z)": ("CONCERN", "By definition, all z values are positive, so the mean is triviality positive"),
    "The test A > B": ("CONCERN", "In our case, this is always true because B is negative and A is positive"),
    "The test C > 0": ("OK", "This is a valid test because ..."),
}


Notes:
(1) Generalize.
The points above are just examples, provided as a basis from which you can generalize to checks relevant to our specific code.
(2) Skip irrelevant points.
If any of the points above are not applicable, you can skip them.
(3) Add more checks.
You can also add as many other relevant checks, both positive ("OK", "...") and negative ("CONCERN", "...").
(4) Be specific.
Be specific in the description of the checks (keys) and assessment (values), so that it is clear what you are referring to in the code.

Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    # * DATASET PREPARATIONS:
    # - Missing values. If applicable, did we deal with missing, unknown, or undefined values,
    # or with special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined?
    # Check the "Description of the Original Dataset" for any such missing values.
    # For example:
    "Missing values": ("OK", "We correctly dealt with missing values"),

    # - Units. If applicable, did we correctly standardize numeric values with different units
    # into same-unit values?
    # For example:
    "Standardizing units": ("CONCERN", "In the comparison of x and y, different units were not standardized"),

    # - Data restriction. If applicable, are we restricting the analysis to the correct part of the data
    # (based on the Hypothesis Testing Plan)?
    # For example:
    "Data restriction": ("OK", "No data restriction is needed. We are correctly using all data"),

    # * DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
    # As applicable, check for issues in the descriptive statistics.
    # For example:
    "Descriptive statistics: presented if needed": ("OK", "The code does not create a descriptive statistics table, but this is ok because ..."),
    "Descriptive statistics: variable choice": ("CONCERN", "We should not have included xxx in the table ..."),
    "Descriptive statistics: Correct data": ("CONCERN", "We mistakenly reported descriptive statistics on the data after normalization"),

    # * PREPROCESSING:
    # Review the above "Description of the Original Dataset", then check our data preprocessing.
    # Are we performing all needed preprocessing steps? Are we mistakenly performing any unneeded steps?
    # For example:
    "Preprocessing": ("CONCERN", "We have normalized all variables, but xxx should not be normalized"),

    # * ANALYSIS:
    # As applicable, check for any data analysis issues, including:

    # - Each analysis is done on the relevant data.
    # For example:
    "Analysis on correct data": ("CONCERN", "We mistakenly performed the xxx analysis on the preprocessed data. This step should have been done on the
original data"),

    # - Choice and implementation of statistical tests.
    # For example:
    "Choice of statistical test": ("CONCERN", "We should have used ttt test instead of sss test, because ..."),
    "Implementation of statistical test <test name>": ("OK", "The implementation is correct, because ..."),

    # - In regressions, in case interactions terms are included:
    # Is the main effect adequately included in the model with interaction terms?
    # Did we use the `*` operator in statsmodels formula as recommended?
    # (as applicable, better use `formula = "y ~ a * b"`, instead of trying to manually multiply the variables)
    # For example:
    "Model with interaction terms":
        ("CONCERN", "We forgot to include the main effect in the xxx model, please use the `*` operator in the formula")

    # - In mediation analysis:
    # did we calculate the mediation effect (e.g., using the Sobel test or other)?
    # did we account for relevant confounding factors?
    # (by adding these same confounding factors to both the 'a' and 'b' paths)
    # For example:
    "Mediation analysis":
        ("CONCERN", "We did not explicitly calculate the mediation effect")

## Request Review of "table_0.pkl"
I ran your code.

Here is the content of the table 'table_0.pkl' that the code created for our scientific paper:

"table_0.pkl":
```output
                       Diabetes_binary  PhysActivity
No Difficulty Walking           0.1053        0.8054
Difficulty Walking              0.3075        0.5149
```


Please review the table and return a list of point-by-point assessments.
Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    # * SENSIBLE NUMERIC VALUES:
    # Check each numeric value in the table and make sure it is sensible.
    # For example:
    "Sensible values": ("OK", "All the values in the table are sensible"),
    "Order of magnitude": ("CONCERN", "Weight values of 10^3 are not sensible"),
    "CI of variables": ("CONCERN", "The CI values of 'xxx' are not flanking the mean of 'xxx'"),
    "Sign of values": ("CONCERN", "Height cannot be negative, but we have negative values"),
    "Zero values": ("CONCERN", "We have zero values for ..., but this is not possible"),

    # * MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY:
    # If the table reports nominal values (like regression coefs),
    # does it also report their measures of uncertainty (like p-value, CI, or STD, as applicable)?
    # For example:
    "Measures of uncertainty": ("CONCERN", "We should have included p-values for ..."),

    # * MISSING DATA:
    # Are we missing key variables, or important results, that we should calculate and report in the table?
    # For example:
    "Missing data": ("CONCERN", "To fit with our hypothesis testing plan, we should have included ..."),
}

# Review of "table_0.pkl"
The code has some issues that need to be fixed:

## Measures of uncertainty
The table does not include measures of uncertainty for the mean values of Diabetes_binary and PhysActivity. We should consider adding standard
deviations or confidence intervals.

## Other
Please fix any other issues that you may find.

# Instructions:
Please rewrite the complete code again with these issues corrected.

# General formatting instructions:
Even if you are changing just a few lines, you must return the complete code again in a single code block, including the unchanged parts, so that I
can just copy-paste and run it.

Here is the revised Python code:


# FULL CODE SENT BY LLM IS SHOWN AS A DIFF WITH PREVIOUS CODE
-## Table 0: "Mean of diabetes diagnosis and physical activity, stratified by difficulty in walking"
-df0 = data.groupby('DiffWalk')[['Diabetes_binary', 'PhysActivity']].mean()
+## Table 0: "Mean and standard deviation of diabetes diagnosis and physical activity, stratified by difficulty in walking"
+mean = data.groupby('DiffWalk')[['Diabetes_binary', 'PhysActivity']].mean()
+std_dev = data.groupby('DiffWalk')[['Diabetes_binary', 'PhysActivity']].std()
+df0 = pd.concat([mean, std_dev], axis=1)
+df0.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([['Diabetes_binary', 'PhysActivity'], ['mean', 'std_dev']], names=['Variable', 'Statistic'])
In the revised code, the Descriptive Statistics Table (df0) now includes standard deviations along with the means of `Diabetes_binary` and
`PhysActivity`, providing a measure of uncertainty for these mean values. Also, the column names are now a MultiIndex reflecting the variables and the
statistics reported.

## Request Review of "table_0.pkl"
I ran your code.

Here is the content of the table 'table_0.pkl' that the code created for our scientific paper:

"table_0.pkl":
```output
Variable              Diabetes_binary         PhysActivity
Statistic                        mean std_dev         mean std_dev
No Difficulty Walking          0.1053  0.8054        0.307  0.3959
Difficulty Walking             0.3075  0.5149       0.4614  0.4998
```


Please review the table and return a list of point-by-point assessments.
Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    # * SENSIBLE NUMERIC VALUES:
    # Check each numeric value in the table and make sure it is sensible.
    # For example:
    "Sensible values": ("OK", "All the values in the table are sensible"),
    "Order of magnitude": ("CONCERN", "Weight values of 10^3 are not sensible"),
    "CI of variables": ("CONCERN", "The CI values of 'xxx' are not flanking the mean of 'xxx'"),
    "Sign of values": ("CONCERN", "Height cannot be negative, but we have negative values"),
    "Zero values": ("CONCERN", "We have zero values for ..., but this is not possible"),

    # * MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY:
    # If the table reports nominal values (like regression coefs),
    # does it also report their measures of uncertainty (like p-value, CI, or STD, as applicable)?
    # For example:
    "Measures of uncertainty": ("CONCERN", "We should have included p-values for ..."),

    # * MISSING DATA:
    # Are we missing key variables, or important results, that we should calculate and report in the table?
    # For example:
    "Missing data": ("CONCERN", "To fit with our hypothesis testing plan, we should have included ..."),
}


Notes:
(1) Generalize.
The points above are just examples, provided as a basis from which you can generalize to checks relevant to our specific code.
(2) Skip irrelevant points.
If any of the points above are not applicable, you can skip them.
(3) Add more checks.
You can also add as many other relevant checks, both positive ("OK", "...") and negative ("CONCERN", "...").
(4) Be specific.
Be specific in the description of the checks (keys) and assessment (values), so that it is clear what you are referring to in the code.

The table is missing the parameter and p-value for 'Sex_1' and 'PhysActivity:Sex_1'. These are important to include as they represent the main effects
of gender and the interaction effect between physical activity and gender, respectively, in the logistic regression model. Including these results in
the table would provide a more complete representation of the analysis.

The table seems to be missing the parameters and p-values for 'Sex_1' and 'PhysActivity:Sex_1'. These are important for our analysis as they represent
the main effect of gender and the interaction effect between physical activity and gender, respectively.

My apologies for the error, it seems the issue is with the column Age_10. Instead of using exact age categories like Age_10, we can use the Age column
as a continuous variable. Here is the corrected code:

Please review the table and return a list of point-by-point assessments.
Your response should be formatted as a Python Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]], mapping the checks you have done (keys) to a Tuple[str, str], indicating
either your concern ("CONCERN", "<your concern>") or your assertion that this check is ok ("OK", "<your assertion>")..

For example:

{
    # * SENSIBLE NUMERIC VALUES:
    # Check each numeric value in the table and make sure it is sensible.
    # For example:
    "Sensible values": ("OK", "All the values in the table are sensible"),
    "Order of magnitude": ("CONCERN", "Weight values of 10^3 are not sensible"),
    "CI of variables": ("CONCERN", "The CI values of 'xxx' are not flanking the mean of 'xxx'"),
    "Sign of values": ("CONCERN", "Height cannot be negative, but we have negative values"),
    "Zero values": ("CONCERN", "We have zero values for ..., but this is not possible"),

    # * MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY:
    # If the table reports nominal values (like regression coefs),
    # does it also report their measures of uncertainty (like p-value, CI, or STD, as applicable)?
    # For example:
    "Measures of uncertainty": ("CONCERN", "We should have included p-values for ..."),

    # * MISSING DATA:
    # Are we missing key variables, or important results, that we should calculate and report in the table?
    # For example:
    "Missing data": ("CONCERN", "To fit with our hypothesis testing plan, we should have included ..."),
}


Notes:
(1) Generalize.
The points above are just examples, provided as a basis from which you can generalize to checks relevant to our specific code.
(2) Skip irrelevant points.
If any of the points above are not applicable, you can skip them.
(3) Add more checks.
You can also add as many other relevant checks, both positive ("OK", "...") and negative ("CONCERN", "...").
(4) Be specific.
Be specific in the description of the checks (keys) and assessment (values), so that it is clear what you are referring to in the code.

The points above are just examples, provided as a basis from which you can generalize to checks relevant to our specific code.
(2) Skip irrelevant points.
If any of the points above are not applicable, you can skip them.
(3) Add more checks.
You can also add as many other relevant checks, both positive ("OK", "...") and negative ("CONCERN", "...").
(4) Be specific.
Be specific in the description of the checks (keys) and assessment (values), so that it is clear what you are referring to in the code.

\section{Code Explanation}

The code performs a data analysis on a dataset containing diabetes-related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) for the year 2015. The analysis aims to investigate the association between physical activity and diabetes, considering various moderating
variables such as difficulty in walking, sex, and age.

First, the code loads the dataset and prepares it for analysis by imputing missing values in the BMI variable using the median imputation method.
Descriptive statistics are then computed for the mean and standard deviation of diabetes diagnosis and physical activity, stratified by difficulty in
walking. The results are saved in a pickle file named "table_0.pkl".

Next, the code preprocesses the data by creating dummy variables for the sex variable. This is done to handle categorical variables in the subsequent
logistic regression analysis.

The code then performs three logistic regression analyses to test the association between physical activity and diabetes, considering different
moderating variables.

In the first analysis, the code tests the moderation effect of difficulty in walking on the association between physical activity and diabetes. The
model includes additional covariates such as BMI, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease or attack, smoking status, and heavy
alcohol consumption. The results of this analysis, including the parameter estimates and p-values for the interaction terms, are saved in a pickle
file named "table_1.pkl".

In the second analysis, the code tests the moderation effect of sex on the association between physical activity and diabetes. The model includes the
same set of covariates as the first analysis. The results, including the parameter estimates and p-values for the interaction terms, are saved in a
pickle file named "table_2.pkl".

In the third analysis, the code tests the moderation effect of age on the association between physical activity and diabetes. Again, the model
includes the same set of covariates as the previous analyses. The results, including the parameter estimates and p-values for the interaction terms,
are saved in a pickle file named "table_3.pkl".

Finally, the code saves additional results in a pickle file named "additional_results.pkl". These results include the total number of observations in
the dataset, as well as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values for each of the three logistic regression models. The AIC values provide a
measure of model fit and can be used for model comparison.

Overall, the code performs a series of analyses to investigate the association between physical activity and diabetes, considering different
moderating variables. The results of these analyses are saved in pickle files for further examination and interpretation.

[11] ---- USER {InterpretationReviewer} -> "LaTeX Table Design Code"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please write a Python code to convert and re-style the "table_?.pkl" dataframes created by our "Data Analysis Code" into latex tables suitable for our
scientific paper.

Your code should use the following 3 custom functions provided for import from `my_utils`:


def to_latex_with_note(df, filename: str, caption: str, label: str, note: str = None, legend: Dict[str, str] = None, **kwargs):
    """
    Converts a DataFrame to a LaTeX table with optional note and legend added below the table.

    Parameters:
    - df, filename, caption, label: as in `df.to_latex`.
    - note (optional): Additional note below the table.
    - legend (optional): Dictionary mapping abbreviations to full names.
    - **kwargs: Additional arguments for `df.to_latex`.
    """

def is_str_in_df(df: pd.DataFrame, s: str):
    return any(s in level for level in getattr(df.index, 'levels', [df.index]) + getattr(df.columns, 'levels', [df.columns]))

AbbrToNameDef = Dict[Any, Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]]

def split_mapping(abbrs_to_names_and_definitions: AbbrToNameDef):
    abbrs_to_names = {abbr: name for abbr, (name, definition) in abbrs_to_names_and_definitions.items() if name is not None}
    names_to_definitions = {name or abbr: definition for abbr, (name, definition) in abbrs_to_names_and_definitions.items() if definition is not None}
    return abbrs_to_names, names_to_definitions



Your code should:

* Rename column and row names: You should provide a new name to any column or row label that is abbreviated or technical, or that is otherwise not
self-explanatory.

* Provide legend definitions: You should provide a full definition for any name (or new name) that satisfies any of the following:
- Remains abbreviated, or not self-explanatory, even after renaming.
- Is an ordinal/categorical variable that requires clarification of the meaning of each of its possible values.
- Contains unclear notation, like '*' or ':'
- Represents a numeric variable that has units, that need to be specified.

To avoid re-naming mistakes, you should define for each table a dictionary, `mapping: AbbrToNameDef`, which maps any original column and row names
that are abbreviated or not self-explanatory to an optional new name, and an optional definition.
If different tables share several common labels, then you can build a `shared_mapping`, from which you can extract the relevant labels for each table.

Overall, the code must have the following structure:


# IMPORT
import pandas as pd
from my_utils import to_latex_with_note, is_str_in_df, split_mapping, AbbrToNameDef

# PREPARATION FOR ALL TABLES
# <As applicable, define a shared mapping for labels that are common to all tables. For example:>
shared_mapping: AbbrToNameDef = {
    'AvgAge': ('Avg. Age', 'Average age, years'),
    'BT': ('Body Temperature', '1: Normal, 2: High, 3: Very High'),
    'W': ('Weight', 'Participant weight, kg'),
    'MRSA': (None, 'Infected with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1: Yes, 0: No'),
    ...: (..., ...),
}
# <This is of course just an example. Consult with the "Description of the Original Dataset" and the "Data Analysis Code" for choosing the labels and
their proper scientific names and definitions.>

# TABLE 0:
df0 = pd.read_pickle('table_0.pkl')

# FORMAT VALUES <include this sub-section only as applicable>
# <Rename technical values to scientifically-suitable values. For example:>
df0['MRSA'] = df0['MRSA'].apply(lambda x: 'Yes' if x == 1 else 'No')

# RENAME ROWS AND COLUMNS <include this sub-section only as applicable>
# <Rename any abbreviated or not self-explanatory table labels to scientifically-suitable names.>
# <Use the `shared_mapping` if applicable. For example:>
mapping0 = dict((k, v) for k, v in shared_mapping.items() if is_str_in_df(df0, k))
mapping0 |= {
    'PV': ('P-value', None),
    'CI': (None, '95% Confidence Interval'),
    'Sex_Age': ('Age * Sex', 'Interaction term between Age and Sex'),
}
abbrs_to_names0, legend0 = split_mapping(mapping0)
df0 = df0.rename(columns=abbrs_to_names0, index=abbrs_to_names0)

# SAVE AS LATEX:
to_latex_with_note(
    df0, 'table_0.tex',
    caption="<choose a caption suitable for a table in a scientific paper>",

    note="<If needed, add a note to provide any additional information that is not captured in the caption>",
    legend=legend0)

# Table row/column labels contain un-allowed characters
Table table_2.tex has index labels containing the character "_" (underscore), which is not allowed.
Here are the problematic index labels:
['PhysActivity:Sex_1[T.True]', 'Sex_1[T.True]']

Please revise the code to map these index labels to new names that do not contain the "_" characters.

Doublecheck to make sure your code uses `df.rename(index=...)` with the `index=` arg.

# Instructions:
Please rewrite the complete code again with these issues corrected.

# General formatting instructions:
Even if you are changing just a few lines, you must return the complete code again in a single code block, including the unchanged parts, so that I
can just copy-paste and run it.
Remember, your code must contain the following sections:

[11] ---- USER {InterpretationReviewer} -> "Figures Code"  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please write a Python code to create figures using the "matplotlib" and "seaborn" packages, and save them as ".png" files with captions and labels for
our scientific paper.

Your code should use the following custom function provided for import from `my_utils`:


def to_latex_figure_with_caption(figure, filename: str, caption: str, label: str, comment: str = None):
    """
    Save a figure with a caption and label.
    """
    figure.savefig(filename)
    latex = f"""
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{{filename.replace(".png", "")}}
        \caption{{caption}}
        \label{{label}}
        \end{figure}
    """
    if comment:
        latex = comment + latex
    with open(filename.replace('.png', '.tex'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(latex)
    return latex


Your code should:

Use matplotlib and seaborn to create the figures.
Ensure each figure is saved as a .png file.
Add a caption and label to each figure using the provided to_latex_figure_with_caption function.
To ensure clarity and consistency, define a dictionary, figure_details, which maps figure identifiers to their corresponding captions and labels. This
will help avoid any mistakes in labeling and captioning.

Overall, the code must have the following structure:


# IMPORT
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from my_utils import to_latex_figure_with_caption

df = pd.read_csv('path/to/datafile.csv')

# PREPARATION FOR ALL FIGURES
figure_details = {
    'fig1': {
        'caption': 'Distribution of variable X',
        'label': 'fig:distribution_x',
    },
    'fig2': {
        'caption': 'Correlation between variables Y and Z',
        'label': 'fig:correlation_y_z',
    },
    # Add more figure details as needed
}

# FIGURE 1:
# Create the figure using matplotlib and seaborn
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
sns.histplot(data=df, x='variable_x', ax=ax1)
# Save the figure with caption and label
to_latex_figure_with_caption(
    fig1, 'figure_1.png',
    caption=figure_details['fig1']['caption'],
    label=figure_details['fig1']['label']
)

# FIGURE 2:
# Create the figure using matplotlib and seaborn
fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='variable_y', y='variable_z', ax=ax2)
# Save the figure with caption and label
to_latex_figure_with_caption(
    fig2, 'figure_2.png',
    caption=figure_details['fig2']['caption'],
    label=figure_details['fig2']['label']
)

# FIGURE ?:
# <etc, all figures required>
Avoid the following:

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write complete runnable code including all '# HEADERS' sections.
Do not create any tables or other output; only create figures.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary libraries and data.
2. Sets up a dictionary to maintain figure details like captions and labels.
3. Creates each figure using matplotlib and seaborn, and saves them as `.png` files with the appropriate caption and label.
4. Uses the provided custom function `to_latex_figure_with_caption` to generate the figures and save the associated LaTeX code for each figure.

Ensure you have defined the custom function in your `my_utils` module and placed it appropriately so it can be imported. Replace
`'path/to/datafile.csv'` with the correct path to your data file if needed.
